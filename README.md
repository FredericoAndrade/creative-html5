Creative HTML5

Creative HTML5 is a Spring 2013 course for BFA students at [Parsons the New School for Design](http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/). This course introduces students to using HTML5 as a platform for creative explorations.

For Students
------------

This is an experiment in itself by using a GitHub repo as the course's website. If you haven't created an account here, do it now, then star/follow this repo. Learn to love Github - because you will get so much out of it. Announcements about the class will be updated in this file. Each week's content - slides, code, assignments and tutorials will be in its own separate folder.

**Note** - If you have code-related questions, please use this repo's [Issues System](https://github.com/yyx990803/creative-html5/issues?state=open). This makes it much easier for me to keep track of your questions. Also, since issues are public, you can help each other out or learn from others' questions.

For Non-students
----------------

If you're not in class but simply want to learn something from this repo, please note that this course is taught at a design school. Most of the students do not have formal training in programming, so I have to make sure those with lesser experience could keep up. Also, I probably don't have enough time during the semester to convert course slides and code examples into reading-friendly tutorials, but I will try to do that afterwards.
