Creative HTML5 is a Spring 2013 course for BFA students at [Parsons the New School for Design](http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/) taught by me, [Evan You](http://www.youyuxi.com). This course is all about how to make cool stuff with HTML5.

This is kind of an experiment in itself by using a GitHub repo as the course's website. If you haven't created an account here, do it now. Learn to love Github - because you will get so much out of it. Announcements about the class will be updated in this file. Each week's content - slides, code, assignments and tutorials will be in its own separate folder.

*Important* - If you have code-related questions, please use this repo's [Issues System](https://github.com/yyx990803/creative-html5/issues?state=open). This makes it much easier for me to keep track of your questions. Also, since issues are public, you can help each other out or learn from others' questions.
