# Week 3 - More JavaScript & Canvas

## Assignment

### 1. Generative Visual Piece

Create a generative, artistic visual piece with the Canvas API. You can build upon last week's work but I encourage you to start fresh. This time you are free on what elements to be used, however you must use the following techniques talked about in class:

- Procedural drawing with for loops
- Randomness with Math.random()

Bonus points:

- Use requestAnimationFrame() and make it an animating piece. (This shoud still include for loops and randomness)

**Submission**

Preferred: post the work online and send me the URL. If you do it this way email submission is not required.
If you are still submitting through email, follow the same naming concention as last week. (Firstname_week3)
