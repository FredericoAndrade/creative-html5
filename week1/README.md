# Week 1 - Introduction

### Assignment

We just went over the syllabus and the structure of the course, nothing particularly interesting. But we'll dive right into code next week. To get ready for that, I want you to do the following:

- Complete this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dC0zTmprUEdTQ1ZPVC1CT3c4a3Vjb0E6MQ#gid=0" target="_blank">Survey</a>
- If you don't have a github account it, sign up and star/watch this repo.
- Go through the <a href="https://github.com/yyx990803/creative-html5/blob/master/RESOURCES.md" target="_blank">Resources Page</a>. Open every link and get a sense of what it is if you haven't seen it before.
- For those of you already know how to use git, clone this repo to your machine and pull often.
- If you do not know how to use git, go over the help section on GitHub, and Google for some intro to git tutorials. Your Mac should come with git already installed. Don't worry if you find it too confusing to figure out - I'll walk you through it in class.

That's it! See ya next week.
