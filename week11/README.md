# Week 11 - JavaScript Events

We breifly discussed how the event system work in JavaScript - now you should have a better idea what jQuery is doing under the hood for you. We will go through some more examples in Week 12.

## Final Project

It's time! We will start working on the final project right after Week 12's class. As I said, it's open ended, but your project **must combine at least two of the following topics** we covered so far:

1. Visual (Canvas, CSS3, Animation)
2. Data (Using an API, building interfaces using data)
3. Interactivity (Mouse, Scroll, Keyboard, Touch)

## Assignment

Before Thursday's class (Apr 18th), submit a one-paragraph proposal for your final project. Explain what are you going to make and why is it cool and worth making. Remember, you have one month to make it, so come up with something epic.
