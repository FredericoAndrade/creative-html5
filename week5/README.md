# Week 5 - Project 1 Critique & A bit about Data

## Assignment

### 1. Visual Piece, Further Improvement

Great job class! Some of you really put a lot of effort into your work. However I also saw that quite a few of you had ideas/goals not fully implemented due to technical difficulties or lack of time. So this week's main task is try to polish your work presented in class (or finish it if it was incomplete). Particularly, if you didn't use constructors in your work you should try to do that this week.

Do use the issue system here on GitHub if you have technical problems. Also it could be helpful to Google or search on StackOverflow! Smart coders are those who know where to get help.

**Submission**

Preferred: update the existing work on your index page.

**Note**

If you are still sending homework via email, try to do that from your newschool address - otherwise I could possibly miss it.

### 2. Read the Data Code Example

We only briefly talked about Data in class. I added some additional stuff in the slides and code example - try to play with it and get an idea of what it's about. You don't need to submit anything for this but it's **required**.
