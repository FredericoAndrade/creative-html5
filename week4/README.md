# Week 4 - Basic OOP Javascript

## Assignment

### 1. Visual Piece, Final Iteration

It's time! For next class you are expected to show your work to the whole class. The general idea is to build upon what you've already built for the past two weeks, but again, if you feel necessary you can restart from scratch. The requirements are:

- You must use constructors/prototypes to create re-usable objects
- The piece should incorporate at least some animating parts, if not all

You should also use the other techniques we have talked about so far, but you are free to mix and match the techniques for your actual needs.

**Submission**

In addition to having it ready to present in class, you should also submit following the same guidelines of last week.

**Archiving Your Work**

I mentioned in class that it would be nice for each of you to have a live web page that serves as an index for your work in this class. This is not required but highly encouraged.

    Javascript's prototype inheritance model is one of the most confusing features about the language. There are many, many posts trying to explain this topic if you Google it, but eventually you need to write it yourself to understand.

    This is the book to read if you want to dig deeper into programatic animation. It's based on Processing, but now that you are (hopefully) equipped with a good understanding of how JavaScript and canvas works, you should be able to adapt a lot of the concepts in this book for the web (without having to use Processing.js).
