# Week 6 - CSS3 & More API

## Assignment

### 1. A Data-driven interface

Build an experimental interface using data from APIs.

**Requirements**

1. Use at least one API. You are free to use as many as you want.
2. Make the interface interesting using CSS3 transforms/transitions/animations. Don't worry too much about usability - again, think of it as making a piece of artwork and explore how data can presented in unconventional forms.

**Bonus Points**

1. Use an API not in the code examples.
2. Combine previous knowledge of JavaScript techniques with this assignment. (e.g. define a constructor that takes in data and creates a DOM element...)

**Submission**

Same as before. I'm going to omit this in later assignments.

### Resources

Please see the links in the deck for documentations on MDN.  
There are also countless tutorials on how to use CSS3 transitions and transforms. They are easier than JavaScript constructors, so just Google them!
