For those of you who feel a bit fuzzy about your JavaScript skills, I recommend that you go through the tutorials on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript" target="blank">Codecademy</a>. Feel free to skip parts that you already know, but make sure you understand the basics. The class will move quite fast so you do not want to be left behind.


## Books

These are all recommended but not required. We will cover basic to intermediate level stuff in class, the following books can be considered further reading in case you want to dig deeper.

### <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Definitive-Guide-Activate-Guides/dp/0596805527/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1358458442&sr=8-1&keywords=definitive+guide+to+javascript" target="_blank">JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</a>

by David Flanigan

For students who are already proficient in a language other than JavaScript, or those who really want to become a JavaScript ninja, I recommend that you get a copy of this book. Itâ€™s massive so I will not require you to read all of it, but it explains every little detail about the language in case you want to dig deep.

### <a href="http://natureofcode.com/" target="_blank">Nature of Code</a>

by Daniel Shiffman

Great book on creative coding techniques. Although the code in the book is not in JavaScript, the concepts and techniques are extremely well articulated and can be easily translated to JavaScript.

### <a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/" target="_blank">Dive Into HTML5</a>

by Mark Pilgrim

A neatly-presented online book that introduces HTML5 features.
