# Week 2 - JavaScript Fundamentals & Intro to Canvas API

## Assignment

### 1. Visual Piece

Create a visual composition with the Canvas API. You must use all the stuff we talked about in class:

- Rectangle
- Circle
- Line
- Linear Gradient (Radial Gradient is similar)
- Image
- Text (I forgot about this in class, but you can find the example in week2/code/canvas)

The composition must have a visual theme, but just a random collage. Think of it as designing a poster with JavaScript. Also think about the possibilities of the elements being animated in future revisions - we will do that as we learn more about programmatic animation.

Bonus points:

1. Figure out how to use context matrix transform to rotate things in canvas and use it in your composition.

2. Explore drawing complex paths combining moveTo(), lineTo() and arc()

**How to submit**

Since most of you don't know how to push stuff to GitHub yet, please zip your files and name it "yourFirstName_week2.zip" then send to my newschool email address.
