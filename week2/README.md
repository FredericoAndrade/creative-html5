# Week 2 - JavaScript Fundamentals & Intro to Canvas API

### Assignment

Create a visual composition with the Canvas API. You must use all 5 things we talked about in class:

- Rectangle
- Circle
- Line
- Linear Gradient (Radial Gradient is similar)
- Text (I forgot about this in class, but you can find the example in week2/code/canvas)

The composition must have a visual theme, but just a random collage. Think of it as designing a poster with JavaScript. Also think about the possibilities of the elements being animated in future revisions - we will do that as we learn more about programmatic animation.

Bonus points: figure out how to use context matrix transform to rotate things in canvas and use it in your composition.

### Git

I assumed Macs come with Git pre-installed but that seems to be the case only for recent models.
You can check if your system have Git by opening Terminal and type in:

    which git

It should print something back if Git is installed. If nothing happens, try downloading and installing git at [http://git-scm.com/downloads](http://git-scm.com/downloads).

After installing, make sure to quit and restart your Terminal. Then try `which git` again. It should be there.

Once you have git, follow the instructions [here]() to clone this repo to your local computer.
