# Week 2 - JavaScript Fundamentals & Intro to Canvas API

### Assignment

Create a visual composition with the Canvas API. You must use all 5 things we talked about in class:

- Rectangle
- Circle
- Line
- Linear Gradient (Radial Gradient is similar)
- Text (I forgot about this in class, but you can find the example in week2/code/canvas)

The composition must have a visual theme, but just a random collage. Think of it as designing a poster with JavaScript. Also think about the possibilities of the elements being animated in future revisions - we will do that as we learn more about programmatic animation.

Bonus points: figure out how to use context matrix transform to rotate things in canvas and use it in your composition.
